		<ul>
		<li>Fresh Baby Bok Choy: Make sure to find the mini baby bok choy with dark green leaves. Or substitute with regular sized bok choy, pak choi or any Asian leafy greens like yu choy sum or baby gai lan (Chinese broccoli) that you find at the Asian market.</li>
		<li>Neutral oil: like avocado oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil, vegetable oil or canola oil with a high smoke point. Avoid olive oil or any heavy scented oils with a low smoke point.</li>
		<li>Fresh garlic cloves</li>
		<li>Water</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Spicy Sauce</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Chili oil: store-bought chili oil or homemade chili oil will work so use one that you enjoy!</li>
		<li>Regular soy sauce: or substitute with low sodium soy sauce or light soy sauce. If you’re gluten-free, substitute with tamari sauce, coconut aminos or a gluten-free soy sauce of your choice.</li>
		<li>Sesame oil: if you're allergic, omit completely.</li>
		<li>Shaoxing wine: or sub with Dry Sherry or any broth of your choice.</li>
		<li>White granulated sugar: to help balance the salty flavors.</li>
		</ul>
